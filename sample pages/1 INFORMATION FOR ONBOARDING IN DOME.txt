DOME Onboarding

INFORMATION FOR ONBOARDING IN DOME

The DOME Marketplace is a digital platform that enables Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to offer cloud and edge computing services to customers across Europe.

The main goal of the onboarding process is the creation of an operating account for the CSPs from which they can operate within the Marketplace and start publishing their offerings.

The process is structured in three main steps:

1. Launching of the process and provision of company information and documentation

2. Verification of the company documentation and contract signature

3. Generation of the verifiable credential for the Legal Entity Appointed Representative (LEAR)

Upon the generation of the LEAR verifiable credential, the CSP is fully operational.

Eligibility Verification

Before launching the onboarding process, make sure that you meet the following criteria:

• You are a legal entity duly registered in an EU country.

• You have the capability to offer cloud or edge services.

Filling Out Forms

After you register your email you will find a form with three sections. Fill in all the fields (all of them are required, except the mobile phone for the LEAR), making sure to use Latin characters.

The information you enter in the forms will be used to generate two of the documents required for the onboarding process. The whole process is described in more detail in the DOME knowledge base: Company Onboarding Process. You can read the description in the knowledgebase and come back here whenever you want.
