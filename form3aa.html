                <h2>ROLE AND POWERS OF THE LEAR</h2>
                <p>The Legal Entity Appointed Representative (hereinafter, the LEAR) is the person that any entity
                    willing to onboard on the DOME Marketplace (hereinafter, the Marketplace) must designate to act,
                    within the scope of the operation of the Marketplace, as the representative of the entity.</p>
                <p>Designating a LEAR is the first step of the onboarding process of the Marketplace.</p>
                <p>The LEAR will be responsible for providing and checking that all the information concerning the
                    entity is accurate and remains up to date at any time.</p>
                <p>The LEAR must have all the capacity and powers to legally represent and bind your entity she/he
                    represents for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Signing contracts on behalf of the entity for the sale or lease of the entity’s products and
                        services of whatever nature;</li>
                    <li>Signing contracts on behalf of the entity for the purchase of goods and services of whatever
                        nature from third parties;</li>
                    <li>Represent the entity before any other third party, be it an individual, a private entity or any
                        public entity or public authority in any kind of proceedings, regardless of their nature (e.g.,
                        informal complaints, arbitration proceedings, jurisdictional proceedings, mediation,
                        negotiation, administrative proceedings, etc.), either as claimant or defendant or interested
                        party or otherwise;</li>
                    <li>Accept payments in whichever form on behalf of the entity;</li>
                    <li>Order payments on behalf of the entity;</li>
                    <li>Make declarations on behalf of the entity, including the submission of offers or proposals
                        (e.g., making a description of cloud or edge services in the Marketplace);</li>
                    <li>Settling any complaint, claim or dispute on behalf of the entity;</li>
                    <li>Delegate any of those faculties on other individuals.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once the LEAR is correctly registered in the Marketplace, the system will generate for her/him a
                    verifiable credential that univocally identifies the LEAR within the Marketplace and enables her/him
                    to digitally sign documents and perform some actions in a secure and non-repudiable fashion
                    vis-à-vis the Marketplace.</p>
                <p>The LEAR will be entitled to delegate some of its faculties to other individuals, who will normally
                    belong to your entity’s organisation. Those delegated persons will also have verifiable credentials
                    enabling them to act within the Marketplace on behalf of your entity within the scope of the
                    delegation. The delegated persons shall not be entitled to further delegated any of their powers
                    and/or faculties.</p>
                <p>The entity shall be bound by any act or action or omission performed by the LEAR or the delegated
                    representatives.</p>
                <p>The contract with the Marketplace must be signed by means of the verifiable credential of the LEAR or
                    an individual vested by the LEAR with the capacity of signing contracts on behalf of the entity.</p>
                <p>The appointment of the LEAR is indefinite in time. Nonetheless, the entity can change its LEAR at any
                    moment. Any acts, actions or omissions performed by the former LEAR will still be valid and binding
                    on the entity represented by the LEAR.</p>
                <p>It is the responsibility of the entity to revoke the designation of an individual as LEAR or as a
                    delegated individual vested with powers to legally bind the entity within the scope of operation of
                    the Marketplace once the entity does not wish to be represented within the Marketplace by such
                    individuals.</p>
                <p>In witness whereof I sign this appointment letter on the date set at the beginning of the letter.</p>
